Update my developer portfolio website with the following improvements:

1. **Project Section Update**
   - In the "HydroWatch" project description, add this exact line:
     “Co-inventor of an IoT solution automating water refilling in livestock farms, reducing manual labor by 80% and water wastage by 30%.”
   - Keep the tone and formatting consistent with other project descriptions.

2. **Animated Project Showcase (Ticker Style)**
   - Below the main “Projects” section, or as a separate strip above the footer, display all project titles in a **single-line horizontal ticker animation** (like a news feed).
   - The ticker should **scroll continuously from right to left**, and when the last project exits the screen, it should **loop smoothly** from the right again.
   - Add **subtle hover effects** (e.g., pause animation and slightly enlarge the hovered project title).
   - Each project name in the ticker should be **clickable**, linking to its corresponding detailed section or GitHub/live demo link.
   - Ensure the ticker animation is **fully responsive** and **performance-optimized** (use CSS `@keyframes` or transform-based animation, not jQuery or heavy JS).
   - Use a **modern, professional style** — e.g., slightly glowing text, minimal shadow, and consistent font with the rest of the site.

3. **Design & Visuals**
   - Keep the color scheme and typography consistent with the existing design.
   - Use smooth transitions (`ease-in-out`), no abrupt looping.
   - Ensure dark mode compatibility if the portfolio supports it.

4. **Accessibility & Performance**
   - The scrolling text must pause when hovered or when the user enables “reduced motion”.
   - Optimize animation for 60fps performance on all screen sizes.
   - The ticker should not interfere with scroll or tab navigation.

5. **Deliverables**
   - Clean, well-commented HTML/CSS/JS code.
   - Example fallback for users with reduced-motion enabled.
   - Update README or documentation to include instructions for editing ticker items (projects).

Please confirm understanding before implementing and ensure the new HydroWatch description and animated ticker appear seamlessly integrated into the existing site’s design.
